🩺 Breast Cancer Detection from Ultrasound Images

This project provides a web-based tool to analyze breast ultrasound images and predict whether a tumor is benign, malignant, or normal using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to support early detection and assist clinicians and patients — not replace professional diagnosis.

🚀 Features

📤 Upload breast ultrasound images (drag-and-drop supported)
🤖 Deep learning model (CNN) trained on real ultrasound datasets
🔍 Instant prediction results
📝 Professional-style guidance and disclaimer
